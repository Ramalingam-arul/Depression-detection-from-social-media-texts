# Depression-detection-from-social-media-texts
I have created code for detecting depression by analysing social media texts using ML classifiers combined with NLP techniques 
In this I have used NLP techniques to preprocessing and Bag of words along with n-gram approach to for feature extraction.
Finally used both single and ensmeble classifiers to test the performance and it resulted in 93% using Logistic Regression.
And i have also developed an working interface(web app) for detecting depression using flask api in python with the well performed LR model.
