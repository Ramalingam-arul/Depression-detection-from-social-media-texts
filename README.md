It is depression detection project where Twitter dataset is used for training and Facebook, Reddit datasets are used for testing.


We have created code for detecting depression by analysing social media texts using ML classifiers combined with NLP techniques.

In this we have used NLP techniques to preprocessing and Bag of words along with n-gram approach to for feature extraction.

Finally used both single and ensmeble classifiers to test the performance and it resulted in 93% using Logistic Regression.

And we have also developed an working interface(web app) for detecting depression using flask api in python with the well performed LR model.

Datasets used are available at:
